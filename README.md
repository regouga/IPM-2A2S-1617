# Human-Computer Interaction <br> Interação Pessoa-Máquina (IPM)
Project of my Human-Computer Interaction course. <br><br>
The Com.ISTo is an interactive table where you can view the restaurant's menu, order a meal (and friends'), order the coffees, or offer a dessert to the girl (or boy!) from the table on the side that wants to make you very impressed. Its touch screen makes it easier to use, and the various sensors and cameras at your table can make your visit more enjoyable. <br><br>
